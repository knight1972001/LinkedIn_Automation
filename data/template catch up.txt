Hi Curtis! Thank you for accepting my connection request. I saw SDET (Software Developer Engineer in Test) job posting from 2 weeks ago and I am currently doing a bit of research on the role to see whether I'd be a good fit.

Would you happen to know anyone on the team I could have a casual chat with to better understand the position?

As a fellow working in the tech space myself, I'd love to learn more about the day-to-day and team culture before I bother you with specific questions on the application process or more opportunities at Priceline.

Thank you!
